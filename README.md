- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with Tkinter for easy navigation and interaction.
- **Attendance Recording**: Automatically records attendance based on recognized faces.
- **Data Storage**: Saves attendance records in a structured format for easy retrieval and analysis.
- **Multi-User Support**: Can manage attendance for multiple users with unique IDs.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Tkinter
- NumPy
- Pandas (for data handling)
